**Holding** <kbd>`ScrollLock`</kbd> for `0.5` seconds *({LINK})* toggles CapsLock **ON** or **OFF**|<kbd>`ScrollLock`</kbd>|`0.5`


*You can also customize the hotkeys and actions as described in the **"Customizing Hotkeys"** section below.*

# {HEADER_1e}

## {HEADER_2}
Sometimes abbreviated as <kbd>`CAPS`</kbd> or <kbd>`CAPSLK`</kbd>. Caps Lock is a toggle key on a computer keyboard, when pressed it causes all letters typed to be in uppercase. Allowing you to switch the letters on your keyboard from lowercase to uppercase without holding <kbd>`Shift`</kbd>.

If you press the Caps Lock key, every letter you type on the keyboard will be automatically capitalized until you press it again to disable it.

For example, when Caps Lock is enabled, the typed letters appear "**LIKE THIS**". When disabled, they appear "**like this**".

## {HEADER_2}
Short for numeric lock or number lock, the Num key, Num Lock, or Num Lk key is on the top-left corner of a keyboard's numeric keypad. The Num Lock key enables and disables the numeric pad.

When *'Num Lock'* is enabled, you can use the numbers on the keypad. When *'Num Lock'* is disabled, pressing those keys activates those key's alternate function. For instance, the arrow keys on the keypad may only be used if *'Num Lock'* is disabled.

**Num lock keys:**

Below is a chart with additional information about what each numeric keypad key does when *'Num Lock'* is enabled and disabled. For example, pressing the <kbd>`2`</kbd> key on the numeric keypad when *'Num Lock'* is enabled enters the number <kbd>`2`</kbd>, and when *'Num Lock'* is off, it will arrow down one line.

Key pad key pressed|Num lock enabled|Num lock disabled
--- | :-: | :-:
<kbd>`0`</kbd>|0|Ins
<kbd>`1`</kbd>|1|End
<kbd>`2`</kbd>|2|↓
<kbd>`3`</kbd>|3|PgDn
<kbd>`4`</kbd>|4|←
<kbd>`5`</kbd>|5|Nothing
<kbd>`6`</kbd>|6|→
<kbd>`7`</kbd>|7|Home
<kbd>`8`</kbd>|8|↑
<kbd>`9`</kbd>|9|PgUp
<kbd>`.`</kbd>|.|Del

## {HEADER_2}
Sometimes abbreviated as <kbd>`ScLk`</kbd>, <kbd>`ScrLk`</kbd>, or <kbd>`Slk`</kbd>, the *'Scroll Lock'* key is found on a computer keyboard, often located close to the pause key. The Scroll Lock key was initially intended to be used in conjunction with the arrow keys to scroll through the contents of a text box. It has also been used to stop the scrolling of text or halt the operation of a program. Today, the key is not often used.

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

- **Fenced code blocks** must be preceded and followed by a newline.
- When used inside _list items_, **fenced code blocks** must be indented as if they were one level deeper that the list item that contains them.

  ````markdown
  - This list item contains a fenced code block.
  - Let's show how it might interact with a list.

    ```
    .code-example {
      property: value;
    }
    ```

  There is a newline above this paragraph because it is both the end of a list and because it follows a fenced code block.
  ````

- As long as the parser supports it; code blocks should not be denoted with indentation. Using back-ticks is much more explicit than 4 spaces or 1 tab.

## Tables

Like fenced code blocks, tables in Markdown are provided by [Markdown Extra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown_Extra) which seems to be pretty widely implemented.

- Pipe characters must be preceded and followed by spaces for readability.
- Table column width should be determined by the longest cell in the column.
- Always format tables so they are readable in pre-processing.

  ```markdown
  # This is completely unreadable, although it is technically valid.

  table header | other table header
  --- | ---
  table data | other table data
  ```

- Never use preceding or trailing pipes when writing tables.

  ```markdown
  | table header | other table header |
  | ------------ | ------------------ |
  | table data   | table data         |
  ```

- Tables must always be preceded and followed by newlines.

### Table example

_This table meets all the criteria:_

```markdown
Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU
```

_A handsome table in pre-processed Markdown is also handsome when rendered:_

Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU

(Quick example: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37`)

[custom badges]: https://shields.io/#your-badge

### Quickstart

Browse a [complete list of badges][shields.io] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!

Use the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.

## Contributing

Shields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues
and pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].

When adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].

This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,
maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.

You can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].

## Development

1. Install Node 16 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.
   Tests need to pass in Node 16 and 17.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.

When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart
itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev
server (`gatsby dev`) should also automatically reload. However the badge
definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,
either run `npm run defs` or manually restart the server.

To debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.
It also works with full URLs like
`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.

Use `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.
[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].

Shields has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development
environment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and
sign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.
Please report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue
[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)

[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the
SVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run
`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:package` to preview changes to the saved
snapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:package` to update them.

The server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).

Daily tests, including a full run of the service tests and overall code coverage, are run via [badges/daily-tests][daily-tests].

## History

b.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a
thing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd
domain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called
[gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thaddée Tyl][espadrine].
The project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code
and closed b.adge.me.

The original badge specification was developed in 2013 by
[Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar
badges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thaddée Tyl redesigned
it with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to
it. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one
is the flat style.

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
